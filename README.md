31st May

Same morning routine...woke up was into newspaper and TV
mom prepared breakfast & lunch for me
left office on time as usual by 8:45..feel irritated if get late due to lunch not packed or otherwise

Afternoon thoughts...if shipra calls me and start conversation stating she missed me, i would go into emotional zone and forget all practical challenges,.,n we go for long term

evening thoughs---supreiya called me asking for mom health,though i was yawning during conversation but felt, is we were married she could be taking care of mom and cooking and household..was felling attracted towards her..
